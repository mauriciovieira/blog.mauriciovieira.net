Finally I found a way to constantly update this blog. I will drop some URLs of the stuff as I read them.

The two below were given at the company miscelaneous chat:

* [Goodbye MongoDB, Hello PostgreSQL](http://developer.olery.com/blog/goodbye-mongodb-hello-postgresql/)
* [The Art of Code Review: A Dropbox Story](http://www.objc.io/issue-22/dropbox.html)

I had to go to the [Octopress website](http://octopress.org) to remember a few things and I am really
excited to read'[this post about 3.0 version](http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/). As soon as
Brandon releases it, I will upgrade this blog.
